# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict cardiovascular diseases using an existing dataset.

## Objectives
- Analyze a dataset related to cardiovascular risk factors.
- Explore and visualize the data to identify significant relationships between variables.
- Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance to identify the most suitable one in terms of accuracy and generalization.

## Content
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Use pandas and NumPy for cleaning and structuring the dataset.
   - Perform an initial exploration to identify patterns and outliers.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Create charts with seaborn and Plotly to analyze relationships between variables and enhance data understanding.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implement machine learning models such as logistic regression, Random Forest, and others.
   - Validate models using techniques like cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

4. **Results and Conclusions**:
   - Compare models based on accuracy, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
   - Discuss key findings and potential future improvements.
